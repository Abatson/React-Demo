# React-Demo


### Things to look at before Wednesday
- [Poki Api](https://pokeapi.co/): This will be the api our webstie will consume
- [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/): This is the library of prebuilt components we will be using
- This Repository: It already has some things set up. Checkout out our app.tsx component and mess around a little. Be ready to reset when we start on Wednesday though.

### To get up and running
- cd into the react-demo folder
- run npm install ( this gets all the dependencies of the project)
- run npm start ( this starts a local server to deliver your website to your computer )
- The above should automatically open your browser on localhost:3000 but if it does not, you can do it manually
